# mangafoxdl
This is an attempt to write a network-facing Haskell program.

## Usage
`mangafoxdl manga_name [from_chapter] [to_chapter]`

## Example
* To list all chapters of Full Metal Panic: `mangafoxdl full_metal_panic`
* To download chapter 1: `mangafoxdl full_metal_panic 1`
* To download chapters 1 to 10: `mangafoxdl full_metal_panic 1 10`
* 

## Disclaimer
* This program serves only as my personal exercise in writing Haskell program that:
  - Uses the network,
  - Creates and saves a ZIP file, and
  - Checking if a JPG file is downloaded correctly.
* It is not to be used to download mangas from mangafox.me
